## Sepsis-associated pathways segregate cancer groups

## Summary
Transcriptome-based systems biology approach segregates cancer into two groups ((termed Sepsis-Like Cancer, or SLC and Cancer Alone, or CA) based on similarity with SS. Host response to infection plays a key role in pathogenesis of SS and SLC. However, we hypothesize that some component of the host response is protective in both SS and SLC.
